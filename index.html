            <div class="content">
                <p>Disclosure and transparency are the backbone of any business organisation. To provide the true and fair view of the organisation, accounting policies play the dominant role as many stakeholders make their decisions on the basis of accounting information disseminated by the organisation. Every Student of Commerce and Accounting should be aware of the broad accounting policies and regulations passed by professional body. The most important aspect of financial fraud is lacuna in the disclosure of accounting information. With rising concern disclosure requirements, every corporate is required to follow the accounting standards issued by the ICAI. Moreover, the present syllabi of B.Com (H) and B.com also comprise the few accounting standards and International Financial Reporting Standards. Therefore, to provide the basic platform to learn the professional aspects of disclosure of accounting information, the activity based one week FDP is initiated by our college on Accounting Standards. The programme is focussed on the practical aspects of accounting concerning disclosure requirements.</p>
